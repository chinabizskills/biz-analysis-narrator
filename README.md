# Business Analysis Narrator

> Turn financial and operating spreadsheets into judgment-rich narratives for management — variance attribution (price vs. volume), trend interpretation, three-line risk warnings, and action recommendations with owners and verification metrics.

**Category:** business-intelligence  |  **License:** CC-BY-4.0  |  **Version:** 1.0.0
**Price:** Free on GitHub & skills.sh (CC BY 4.0). Pro & Enterprise on Agensi: $29/month · $290/year · $199/month.

## What it does

Executives can read a spreadsheet; they can't read what the spreadsheet means. Finance and ops burn 10+ hours a month copying numbers into slides and still can't write the 'why' and the 'so what'.

Turns tables into reports with judgment using a four-question narrative framework: what happened, why (variance attribution), where's the risk, so what (recommendations).

## What you get

- Variance attribution in three moves: price vs. volume decomposition, mix shift, one-off stripping.
- Three-line risk warnings: cash runway < 3 months, single-customer concentration > 30%, fixed-cost share jumping MoM.
- Recommendations: 2-3 executable items, each tagged with expected impact + owner role + verification metric.
- Outputs: one-page boss summary (5 sentences + 3 numbers + 1 decision request) and a full report with chart suggestions and detail annexes.
